Description: Functions for reconstructing individual-level data (time, status, arm) from Kaplan-MEIER curves published in academic journals (e.g. NEJM, JCO, JAMA). This individual-level data can be used for re-analysis, meta-analysis, methodology development, etc. ‘reconstructKM’ was used to generate the data for commentary such as Sun, Rich, & Wei (2018) <doi:10.1056/NEJMc1808567>.
